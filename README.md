# DIY-Guide-to-Windows-Bash
**Goal of this Guide**
* As a Developer I find it can be rather difficult to develop on windows machines. Following post on stack overflow are not always easy to understand and can be outdated. My hope is that this guide will help young developers learn how to develop on their Windows 10 computers. 

**What is included in this Guide**
* [Setting up Windows 10 Bash]()
* [Ruby]()
* [Python]()
* [Golang]()
* [PostgreSQL]()
* [MongoDB]()
